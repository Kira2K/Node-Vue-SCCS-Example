Hi everyone!

You are here to check out my Vue CLI and NodeJS skills, and i'm happy to show you my best. However, for last half year i was working on one big project, so it could have been harsh to understand anything in hundreds files and tens of thousands of strings. So i have decided to put in this repo just 3 files, by them i could show you my main skills.

In VuePart.vue you are welcome to check out my Vue CLI skills as well as BEM-layout.
In StorePart.js there is standart Vue CLI Store logic. I have deliberately put here Axios as well as Fetch "action" examples.
In ServerPart.js you can see 2 examples of Express and Router work. I use MongoDB as database here.
According to fact, that this 3 files are just a small part of a big project, you unfortunately can't just pull and test this, however you are always welcome to check out the whole project here: http://env-3501265.jelastic.regruhosting.ru/home
